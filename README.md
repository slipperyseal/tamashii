# NYX Robot Prototype for NuttX

This project is a minimal prototype port of the NYX robotics controller to NuttX.
This was presented at the NuttX Online Workshop, 2020.

The prototype demonstrates the use of GPS and Wifi modules to broadcast simulated
navigational telemetry of the NYX robot. 

The project was built for and tested on an STM32F4 Discovery compatible board.

The `catchpole` directory is to be added to the NuttX `apps` directory.

This project is part of the Robotics Mission to Antarctica
